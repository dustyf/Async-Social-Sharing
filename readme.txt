Simple social plugin that loads the third-party sharing scripts asynchronously after the page loads for optimal site performance.

== Description ==


Simple social sharing plugin that loads the third-party scripts asynchronously and after the page loads to improve site performance.

The plugin provides settings to load any of the following sharing widgets:

*	Twitter
*	Facebook
*	Google+
*	Linkedin
*	Hacker News

Select option (if desired) to display the sharing widgets on blog and archive pages.

Why is Asynchronous script loading better?
Asynchronous loading allows multiple files to load parallel to each other. Instead of having to wait for Twitter to respond with their script, the browser moves on and starts fetching the next request.

Dependencies

*	jQuery 1.7
*	WordPress 3.0+
*	Content worth sharing

Upcoming Versions Wishlist

*	Allow re-arranging of social widgets
* Allow social widgets to be displayed under post excerpts
